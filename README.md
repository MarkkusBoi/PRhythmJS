# PRhythmJS
PRhythmJS is a HTML/JavaScript project looking to recreate the Persona Dancing rhythm games' gameplay.

# What this project is
- Recreation of the rhythm game portion of the Persona Dancing titles
- Primarily a development challenge for me

# What this project is *not*
- Guarenteed to ever be finished or fully functional
    - It is entirely possible that I move on to other projects and leave this one behind
- A full remake of all the Persona Dancing games' content
    - This means that story/social aspects are not in the scope
 - Written by a professional game developer
    - Code will be messy and might not perform well; I'm still just learning here

# Running
The project can be ran by cloning or donwloading a zip of the project, extracting it, and opening rhythm.html in a browser.
There is also a GitHub Pages deployment [here.]("https://markkusboi.github.io/PRhythmJS/")
